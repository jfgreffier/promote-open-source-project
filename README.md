<h1 align="center">Open source promotion cheat sheet</h1>

> This cheat sheet summarizes important steps you should follow to promote your open source project in the best conditions. You can click items to expand and get more information from a topic.

## 1. üé¢ Preparation step

<br />

- [ ] üëå Make sure that your project is mature enough
> Your project must be stable enough with the minimum viable features in order to hook users.

- [ ] üòé Choose a cool name for your cool project
> Choose a name that users can easily remember.

- [ ] üíÖ Make your README pretty
> The README is the first thing your visitors will see. Make it simple, pretty and easy to read. [Here is a list of beautiful READMEs](https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme).

- [ ] üí™ Highlight the strong points of your project
> Identify your project's strengths and make sure visitors see them first.

- [ ] ‚ú® Provide a demo of your project
> Visitors will want to quickly understand the purpose of your project, how it works, and how to use it. Providing a demo is the best way to satisfy users. It could be:
>
> - An animated GIF demonstrating how your project works
> - A link to a live demo

- [ ] üëå Install/Usage must be super easy
> You'll probably lose visitors if your project is not user-friendly.

- [ ] üìò Create a clean and well structured documentation
> Creating a good documentation is probably the most important step. If you have a small documentation, you can include it within your README. Otherwise, you should probably host it in a separate website. Some open source projects like [vuepress](https://v1.vuepress.vuejs.org) can help you with creating a clean documentation in a simple way.

<br />

## 2. üì¢ Spread the word about your hard works

<br />

- [ ] ‚≠ê Make your project trustable before publishing it on social networks
> Most visitors will check how many stars the project has before considering using it. A minimum amount of stars makes your project more trustable than a project with zero star. This is why you should ask people you know to support your project before doing a public announcement on social media.

- [ ] ‚ÜóÔ∏è Share your project on social media and specialized platforms
> Tell the World about your awesome work! Publish it on social media and other specialized platforms:
>
> - [Twitter](https://twitter.com)
> - [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/)
> - [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/)
> - [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/)
> - [Dev.to](https://dev.to/)
> - [Lobsters](https://lobste.rs/)
> - [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/)
> - [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/)
> - [Beta page](https://betapage.co/)
> - [Human Coders](https://news.humancoders.com/)

- [ ] üìÉ Write articles that mention your project
> Write articles about your project. Purpose can be the technical stack you used, how your project works, problems you encountered, etc. Post it to publishing platforms:
>
> - [medium](https://medium.com/)
> - [dev.to](https://dev.to/)

- [ ] üé§ Present your project at conferences/meetups
> Presenting your project at conferences or meetups is a good way to improve its visibility.

- [ ] üé• Record and publish videos presenting your project, how it works, etc
> Recording a video is not an easy exercise. However, it's probably the most efficient way to make your project famous.

- [ ] üïê Choose the best time to publish on social media
> Don't publish during holiday periods or weekends. The best time to publish on social networks is usually mid-week.

- [ ] üóë Don't spam platforms with your promotion
> Don't publish twice on the same platform. It will be considered as spam and it might cause bad publicity for your project.

<br />

## 3. ü§ù Keep your users

<br />

- [ ] üÜï Try to regularly release new versions of your project
> Maintain and improve your project with new releases and generate changelogs.

- [ ] ‚ùó Maintain your project, process opened issues
> Do not let issues stay open without a single response. Be nice with people that took the time to open issues. üòâ

- [ ] üôè Invite users to contribute
> A healthy project is a project with a community and contributors. Let your users know that you need help by tagging some issues with `contribution welcome` or `good first issue` labels. [See github labels](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-labels).

- [ ] üèÜ Reward contributors
> Be nice with people that helped you! Some open source projects like [gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby) reward contributors with goodies. If you can't afford that, do a public post (on twitter or other platforms) about the contribution and mention the author ([here is an example of public thanks](https://twitter.com/FranckAbgrall/status/1139470547492978688)). Open a `Contributors` section in your README to publicly thank them or showcase them on your project documentation or website. Here are some examples:
>
> - [vuepress (contributors README section)](https://github.com/vuejs/vuepress#code-contributors)
> - [Rythm.js (random highlighted contributor on demo page)](https://okazari.github.io/Rythm.js/)

- [ ] üí¨ Open a community chat platform
> Github issues are not always the best way to communicate with your users. If necessary, you can use chat platforms to discuss with them:
>
> - [Discord](https://discord.com)
> - [Slack](https://slack.com)
> - [Gitter](https://gitter.im/)

- [ ] üîô Ask for feedback
> User feedback is the best way to improve your project. They probably have features and ideas that could make your project better.
- [ ] ‚ù§Ô∏è Open a use case gallery to show what users built with your project
> Visitors will trust your project if they see concrete use cases and success stories, e.g., [the vuepress gallery](https://vuepress.gallery/).
